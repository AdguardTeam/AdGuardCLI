## Overview

AdGuard CLI is the command-line version of AdGuard Ad Blocker. Learn more about it [in our Knowledge base](https://adguard.com/kb/adguard-for-linux/).

## Installation

To install the latest version of AdGuard CLI, run the following command:

Release channel:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardCLI/release/install.sh | sh -s -- -v
```

Beta channel:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardCLI/beta/install.sh | sh -s -- -v
```

Nightly channel:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardCLI/nightly/install.sh | sh -s -- -v
```

## Verify Releases

Inside an archive file, there is a small file with a `.sig` extension that contains the signature data. In a hypothetical situation where the binary file inside an archive is replaced by someone, you’ll know it isn’t an official release from AdGuard.

To verify the signature, you need to have the `openssl` tool version 1.1.1 or newer installed.

First, import the AdGuard public key:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardCLI/master/adguard_ed25519_pubkey.pem -o adguard_ed25519_pubkey.pem
```

It will download public key, which should have the value `MCowBQYDK2VwAyEAN0NPZFtolGN+Cjyorh4Wo91vnBlLLQiWkbujeHDYbok=`.

Then, verify the signature:

```shell
openssl pkeyutl -verify -inkey adguard_ed25519_pubkey.pem -pubin -sigfile /opt/adguard-cli/adguard-cli.sig -in /opt/adguard-cli/adguard-cli -rawin
```

If you use a custom installation path, replace `/opt/adguard-cli` with the path to the adguard-cli and its signature file.

You’ll see the following message:

```
Signature Verified Successfully
```

### Per-app AdGuard CLI configuration
AdGuard CLI behaviour can be configured per-app. See the `apps` section of `proxy.yaml` for details.
There's a number of pre-configured entries for popular web browsers,
contained in `browsers.yaml` and included by default.

## AdGuard VPN CLI interaction

Using AdGuard CLI in **automatic proxy mode** together with AdGuard VPN CLI in **tunnel mode** is impossible due to a
routing loop: AdGuard VPN CLI's traffic currently can not be excluded from being transparently proxied by AdGuard CLI,
and AdGuard CLI's traffic must go through the AdGuard VPN CLI's tunnel.
These are the two possible solutions:

1. Switch AdGuard CLI to **manual proxy mode**.
    - In this case, AdGuard VPN CLI can be used in **tunnel mode**, but apps for which ad blocking is desired must be
      manually configured to use the AdGuard CLI's proxy.
2. Switch AdGuard VPN CLI to **SOCKS5 mode**, and configure AdGuard CLI with an outbound proxy pointing to the SOCKS5
   interface of AdGuard VPN CLI.
    - Note that in this case for an app's traffic to go through the VPN tunnel it must either have its traffic
      transparently proxied by AdGuard CLI (which is the case for all apps by default), or manually configured to use
      AdGuard VPN CLI's SOCKS5 interface.
    - Also note that in this case, in order to avoid a routing loop, the `skip_outbound_proxy` option must be enabled
      for AdGuard VPN CLI in AdGuard CLI's apps configuration section. By default, `skip_outbound_proxy` is enabled for
      all apps with `vpn` in their name, which includes AdGuard VPN CLI.
